# C\# benchmarks for measuring performance of structures and classes

## Purpose

This repo contains a .NET Core project for benchmarking selected fundamentals
from C#. Usually around object and structures but not limited to those.

To perform benchmark I'm using great library - [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet).


## Performing benchmarks

To perform benchmarks from this project you have to got .NET Core installed, cloned this repo
and based on your OS:

* On Windows just run (double click or in cmd) `RunOnWindows.cmd`.  
* On Linux run in terminal: `bash RunOnLinux.sh`.

In case of other version of .NET Core than `3.1` above scripts should be
adjusted.


## Benchmark result analysis

*TODO*: There will be some python scripts for presenting results.
